This solves it :)\n\n\n### Condition variables\nSimilar to future-promises but can be used many times.\nA `std::condition_variable` has a method `wait()`, which blocks, when it is called by a thread. The condition variable is kept blocked until it is released by another thread. The release works via the method `notify_one()` or the `notify_all method`. The key difference between the two methods is that notify_one will only wake up a single waiting thread while notify_all will wake up all the waiting threads at once.\n\n\nWe enter the wait state (in following code) while at same time releasing the lock. It is only inside wait, that the mutex is temporarily unlocked - which is a very important point to remember: We are holding the lock before AND after our call to wait - which means that we are free to access whatever data is protected by the mutex.\n\n","metadata":{},"id":"17c90748-a778-4659-a004-d3d42dace5f3"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#include <iostream>\n#include <thread>\n#include <queue>\n#include <future>\n#include <mutex>\n#include <algorithm>\n\ntemplate <class T>\nclass MessageQueue\n{\npublic:\n    T receive()\n    {\n        // perform queue modification under the lock\n        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> uLock(_mutex);\n        _cond.wait(uLock, [this] { return !_messages.empty(); }); // pass unique lock to condition variable\n\n        // remove last vector element from queue\n        T msg = std::move(_messages.back());\n        _messages.pop_back();\n\n        return msg; // will not be copied due to return value optimization (RVO) in C++\n    }\n\n    void send(T &&msg)\n    {\n        // simulate some work\n        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));\n\n        // perform vector modification under the lock\n        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> uLock(_mutex);\n\n        // add vector to queue\n        std::cout << \"   Message \" << msg << \" has been sent to the queue\" << std::endl;\n        _messages.push_back(std::move(msg));\n        _cond.notify_one(); // notify client after pushing new Vehicle into vector\n    }\n\nprivate:\n    std::mutex _mutex;\n    std::condition_variable _cond;\n    std::deque<T> _messages;\n};\n\nint main()\n{\n    // create monitor object as a shared pointer to enable access by multiple threads\n    std::shared_ptr<MessageQueue<int>> queue(new MessageQueue<int>);\n\n    std::cout << \"Spawning threads...\" << std::endl;\n    std::vector<std::future<void>> futures;\n    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)\n    {\n        int message = i;\n        futures.emplace_back(std::async(std::launch::async, &MessageQueue<int>::send, queue, std::move(message)));\n    }\n\n    std::cout << \"Collecting results...\" << std::endl;\n    while (true)\n    {\n        int message = queue->receive();\n        std::cout << \"   Message #\" << message << \" has been removed from the queue\" << std::endl;\n    }\n\n    std::for_each(futures.begin(), futures.end(), [](std::future<void> &ftr) {\n        ftr.wait();\n    });\n\n    std::cout << \"Finished!\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"97359111-b7c7-44d0-af0a-2ca012d9b598"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the main() function, there is still the polling loop that infinitely queries the availability of new Vehicle objects.
