Only the thread which acquired the lock can unlock the mutex and give all remaining threads the chance to acquire the lock.\n\nA `std::lock_guard` object, keeps an associated mutex locked during the entire object life time. The lock is acquired on construction and released automatically on destruction.\n\nThis makes it impossible to forget unlocking a critical section. Also, `std::lock_guard` guarantees exception safety because any critical section is automatically unlocked when an exception is thrown. In our previous example, we can simply replace `_mutex.lock()` and `_mutex.unlock()` with the following code:","metadata":{},"id":"15108c4b-eaf1-423d-a7eb-6af189bfbfce"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#include <iostream>\n#include <thread>\n#include <vector>\n#include <future>\n#include <mutex>\n#include<algorithm>\n\nstd::mutex mtx;\ndouble result;\n\nvoid printResult(int denom)\n{\n    std::cout << \"for denom = \" << denom << \", the result is \" << result << std::endl;\n}\n\nvoid divideByNumber(double num, double denom)\n{\n    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lck(mtx);\n    try\n    {\n        // divide num by denom but throw an exception if division by zero is attempted\n        if (denom != 0) \n        {\n            result = num / denom;\n            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1)); \n            printResult(denom);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw std::invalid_argument(\"Exception from thread: Division by zero!\");\n        }\n    }\n    catch (const std::invalid_argument &e)\n    {\n        // notify the user about the exception and return\n        std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;\n        return; \n    }\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // create a number of threads which execute the function \"divideByNumber\" with varying parameters\n    std::vector<std::future<void>> futures;\n    for (double i = -5; i <= +5; ++i)\n    {\n        futures.emplace_back(std::async(std::launch::async, divideByNumber, 50.0, i));\n    }\n\n    // wait for the results\n    std::for_each(futures.begin(), futures.end(), [](std::future<void> &ftr) {\n        ftr.wait();\n    });\n\n    return 0;\n}","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"06341e9b-0791-4167-b1c6-8ea35ac4c7e9"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This could also be changed so that the mutex is only locked for the time when result is modified and the result is printed.","metadata":{},"id":"785e510f-303d-45b6-8ba9-4bb8f59a35d2"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"void divideByNumber(double num, double denom)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // divide num by denom but throw an exception if division by zero is attempted\n        if (denom != 0) \n        {\n            std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lck(mtx);\n            \n            result = num / denom;\n            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(1)); \n            printResult(denom);\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            throw std::invalid_argument(\"Exception from thread: Division by zero!\");\n        }\n    }\n    catch (const std::invalid_argument &e)\n    {\n        // notify the user about the exception and return\n        std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;\n        return; \n    }\n}","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"cba423a5-0170-4e37-8fb1-ac87f8c5d969"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Unique lock\nA more flexible alternative to `std::lock_guard` is `std::unique_lock`, that also provides support for more advanced mechanisms, such as deferred locking, time locking, recursive locking, transfer of lock ownership and use of condition variables (which we will discuss later).

As before, the lock object `lck` will unlock the mutex in its destructor, i.e. when the function `divideByNumber` returns and `lck` gets out of scope. In addition to this automatic unlocking, `std::unique_lock` offers the additional flexibility to engage and disengage the lock as needed by manually calling the methods `lock()` and `unlock()`. This ability can greatly improve the performance of a concurrent program, especially when many threads are waiting for access to a locked resource. In the example, the lock is released before some non-critical work is performed (simulated by `sleep_for`) and re-engaged before some other work is performed in the critical section and thus under the lock again at the end of the function. This is particularly useful for optimizing performance and responsiveness when a significant amount of time passes between two accesses to a critical resource.\n\nThe main advantages of using `std::unique_lock<>` over `std::lock_guard` are briefly summarized in the following. Using `std::unique_lock` allows you to:\n\n1.  Construct an instance without an associated mutex using the default constructor\n2.  Construct an instance with an associated mutex while leaving the mutex unlocked at first using the deferred-locking constructor\n3.  Construct an instance that tries to lock a mutex, but leaves it unlocked if the lock failed using the try-lock constructor\n4.  Construct an instance that tries to acquire a lock for either a specified time period or until a specified point in time\n\nDespite the advantages of `std::unique_lock<>` and `std::lock_guard` over accessing the mutex directly, however, the deadlock situation where two mutexes are accessed simultaneously (see the last section) will still occur.","metadata":{},"id":"b3c3a3ae-e855-4320-b04b-595e4f54bfef"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Avoiding deadlocks from \n\nIn the following deadlock-free code, std::lock is used to ensure that the mutexes are always locked in the same order, regardless of the order of the arguments. Note that std::adopt_lock option allows us to use `std::lock_guard` on an already locked mutex.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, programmers should try to avoid using several mutexes at once. Practice shows that this can be achieved in the majority of cases. For the remaining cases though, using `std::lock` is a safe way to avoid a deadlock situation.","metadata":{},"id":"0d528597-a48c-4879-8fb2-39f57714eede"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#include <iostream>\n#include <thread>\n#include <mutex>\n \nstd::mutex mutex1, mutex2;\n \nvoid ThreadA()\n{\n    // Ensure that locks are always executed in the same order\n    std::lock(mutex1, mutex2);\n    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock2(mutex2, std::adopt_lock);\n    std::cout << \"Thread A\" << std::endl;\n    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock1(mutex1, std::adopt_lock);\n    \n}\n \nvoid ThreadB()\n{\n    std::lock(mutex1, mutex2);\n    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock1(mutex1, std::adopt_lock);\n    std::cout << \"Thread B\" << std::endl;\n    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock2(mutex2, std::adopt_lock);\n}\n \nvoid ExecuteThreads()\n{\n    std::thread t1( ThreadA );\n    std::thread t2( ThreadB );\n \n    t1.join();\n    t2.join();\n \n    std::cout << \"Finished\" << std::endl;\n}\n \nint main()\n{\n    ExecuteThreads();\n \n    return 0;\n}","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"c0865a13-b473-45cd-8b11-1cf5f76af262"},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"3cc29b99-01de-4cae-9fb9-5a458a0f58a5"}]}
